# MQTT_project

Project to simulate sensor data and connect to MQTT broker tu publish and retreive that data. Then the data is checked and outliers discarded.

The MQTT host is my personal HiveMQ broker with one publisher and one subscriber. This should be changed to connect to different brokers.
The database route was defined for my folder structure, this also has to be changed to adapt to different structures.
